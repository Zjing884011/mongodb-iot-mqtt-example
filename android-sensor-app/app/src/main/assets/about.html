<h1 id="mongodb-iot-example">MongoDB IoT Example</h1>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>The context of the solution is to provide an example of how to use IoT applications with MongoDB as a database.</p>
<p>Basically this is my extension of a talk given by John Page on MongoDB Days Munich 2014. It's lacking the paper, but it has more to do with the 'things' in IoT :)</p>
<p>In this example, data is transmitted using MQTT as broker solution.</p>
<p>Once published on the broker, sensor data from a mobile application gets received by a node.js application by subscription and stored in the database.</p>
<h2 id="conventions">Conventions</h2>
<p>Requirements level are to be treated according to RFC2119 ("Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels").</p>
<p>Timestamps must be specified as Unix Timestamp from epoch start (01/01/1970) in milliseconds.</p>

<p>The Android application gathers data from the mobile device's accelerometer and publishes it onto a MQTT broker.</p>

<p>Component responsible for persistent storage of received data from MQTT broker.</p>
<h4 id="docker-server-environment-docker-image">Docker Server Environment (docker-image)</h4>
<p>This is a Dockerfile for server side environment which sets up Mosquitto, MongoDB and node.js for use.</p>
<h3 id="cots-solutions">COTS Solutions</h3>
<h4 id="mongodb">MongoDB</h4>
<p>MongoDB is to be used as datastore due to its scalability properties.</p>
<h4 id="mosquitto">Mosquitto</h4>
<p>Mosquitto is a standalone MQTT broker solution running in a hosted environment.</p>
<h2 id="interface-descriptions">Interface Descriptions</h2>
<p>Data is exchanged by using MQTT (Message Queue Telemetry Transport) as a bus / PubSub provider.</p>
<p>Data is published to one or more topics.
    Supported topics <em>must</em> follow the convention "device/{deviceName}/{subTopic}".</p>
<p>"{deviceName}" corresponds to a dynamic device name of a mobile. Here the (weak) assumption is made that the model name of the mobile device is unique enough for testing purposes.</p>
<p>"{subTopic}" may be one of the following:</p>
<p>"debug": Subtopic for debug output. Subscribed payload on persistent DB logger shall be print on screen.</p>
<p>"accelerometer": Subtopic for transmission of device accelerometer sensor data. Subscribed payload on persistent DB logger must be stored in database. The payload is defined as a JSON object "{ 'x' : 0, 'y' : 0, 'z' : 0 } where "x"-"z" correspond to device acceleration in the corresponding orientation axis. This payload is wrapped on-wire in a Sensor Data DTO (Data Transfer Object) which looks like "{'payload' : { ... }, 'timestamp': 0}" where "timestamp" is defined as time the sensor event was recorded and "payload" is the object structure defined above as payload.</p>
<h2 id="data-architecture">Data Architecture</h2>
<p>Data is stored inside a single mongod instance or distributed among a cluster using sharding (the shard key is as of yet undefined, but will probably require an hashed index).</p>
<p>The received data from devices gets immediately stored in a collection 'rawData'. </p>
<p>The document schema for accelerometer data contains the values for "x"-"z" as defined above, for every document a composite id consisting of the sensor data timestamp and the unique device name.</p>
